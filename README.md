# C Programming Project: Basic Bank Simulator

## Project Overview
This is a simple **Bank Simulator** implemented in **C**.  
The program allows a user to perform basic banking operations such as:

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance
- Exit the program

The project demonstrates the use of **functions**, **loops**, and **pointers** in C programming.

## Features
1. **Deposit**: Add money to the account.  
2. **Withdraw**: Withdraw money if sufficient balance is available.  
3. **Check Balance**: View current account balance.  
4. **Exit**: Quit the simulator.  

The program maintains the balance as a float and updates it dynamically using pointers.
